# 🐳 Docker - Containerization Made Simple

Docker is a **software tool** that packages **code, libraries, and dependencies** into a single unit, called a **container**. It simplifies application deployment and ensures **portability** across different environments using **Dockerfiles**.

🚀 **Docker makes running microservices easy by containerizing applications!**

## ⚙️ Setting Up Docker Environment
Before using Docker, we need to set up an **environment** for **containerization**.

### 🏗️ Ways to Create a Docker Environment
1. 🖥️ **Docker Desktop** (For Windows & macOS)
2. 🏢 **Installing Docker on Virtual Machines (VMs)**
3. ☁️ **Docker on Cloud Platforms:**
   - 🟠 **AWS ECS, ECR**
   - 🔵 **Azure VMs**
   - 🌍 **GCP Docker**
   - 🚀 **OpenShift Docker**
4. 🐳 **Run Docker inside a Docker container** (Docker-in-Docker)
5. 🏠 **Docker on Bare Metal Servers** (Self-hosted environment)
6. ☸️ **Running Docker with Kubernetes (K8s)**

---

## 🖥️ How to Set Up Docker Desktop
1. **Download and install Docker Desktop** from the [official website](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).
2. **Install Git Bash** (for Windows users).

```

         🖼️ Docker Image
         ⚙️ Docker Daemon
       🏠 Docker Environment
          🐧 Linux OS
        🖥️ Docker Desktop
          🏁 Windows OS
```

## ☁️ How to Set Up Docker on Cloud Instances (EC2): Linux-Based VMs

```
        🏗️ Docker Container
         🖼️ Docker Image
         ⚙️ Docker Daemon
       🏠 Docker Environment
          🐧 Linux OS
   ☁️ Cloud Infrastructure (EC2 Instance)
```

### 📜 Installation Commands for Linux (Ubuntu)
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install docker.io -y
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl enable docker
```

---

## ⬇️ How to Pull an Image from Docker Hub
To pull an image from Docker Hub, use:
```bash
docker pull image-name
```
Example:
```bash
docker pull nginx
```
This command downloads the `nginx` image from Docker Hub to your local machine.

To list all downloaded images:
```bash
docker images
```

---

## 📝 Example: Writing a Dockerfile for Nginx

A **Dockerfile** defines the environment for your container. Below is an example Dockerfile for running an **Nginx web server**:

```dockerfile
# Use the official Nginx base image  
FROM nginx:latest  

# Copy custom static files to Nginx's HTML directory  
COPY index.html /usr/share/nginx/html/  

# Expose port 80 to allow traffic  
EXPOSE 80  

# Start Nginx when the container starts  
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]  
```

### 📌 Steps to Create and Use the Dockerfile:
1️⃣ **Create a file** named `Dockerfile` (without any extension).  
2️⃣ **Copy** the above content into the file.  
3️⃣ **Build an image** from this Dockerfile using:
   ```bash
   docker build -t my-nginx .
   ```
4️⃣ **Run the container** from the built image:
   ```bash
   docker run -d --name my-nginx-container -p 8080:80 my-nginx
   ```
   Now, you can access your Nginx server at **http://localhost:8080**! 🚀  

---

## 🏗️ How to Build a Docker Image
To build an image from a Dockerfile, run:
```bash
docker build -t my-image-name .
```

- `-t my-image-name` → Tags the image with a name.
- `.` → Refers to the current directory where the Dockerfile is located.

---

## ▶️ How to Run a Container from an Image
To run a container from a Docker image, use:
```bash
docker run -d --name my-container -p host-port:Application-port my-image-name
```

---

## 🚀 Important Docker Commands
### 📜 List Docker Images
```bash
docker images
```
### 📜 List Running Containers
```bash
docker ps
```
### 📜 Remove a Docker Image
```bash
docker rmi image-id
```
### 🗑️ Remove Multiple Images
```bash
docker rmi $(docker images -q) -f
```
### 🗑️ Remove a Container
```bash
docker rm container-id
```
### 🗑️ Remove Multiple Containers
```bash
docker rm $(docker ps -a -q) -f
```

# Managing Files and Logs in Docker Containers with Volume Mounts Concept

When working with Docker containers, you may need to modify configuration files, monitor logs, or update content without rebuilding the container. Docker volumes allow us to achieve this efficiently.  

## 📌 Copying a File from the Container to the Host  
To copy a file from a running container to the host machine, use:  

```sh
winpty docker run --rm -v "//c/Users/kamin/OneDrive/Desktop/mysql-prometheus-grafana/data:/mnt" \
    nginx sh -c "cp /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html /mnt"
```
- This command runs a temporary Nginx container and copies the `index.html` file from inside the container to the mounted host directory.

## 📌 Updating Files Inside a Running Container  
To change a specific file inside a container from outside, use **volume mounting**. For example, if you want to update an `index.html` file in an Nginx container:  

```sh
docker run -d --name nginx-container -p 8090:80 \
    -v "//c/Users/kamin/OneDrive/Desktop/mysql-prometheus-grafana/data/index.html:/usr/share/nginx/html/index.html" \
    nginx
```
Here,  
- `-v <local_path>:<container_path>` mounts the local `index.html` file into the container.  
- Any changes made to `index.html` on the host system will reflect inside the container instantly.  
  

## 📌 Mounting Logs for Easy Access  
For debugging and monitoring, mount the container logs directory to a local path:  

```sh
docker run -itd --name nginx-logs-container -p 8091:80 \
    -v "//c/Users/kamin/OneDrive/Desktop/mysql-prometheus-grafana/nginx-logs:/var/log/nginx" \
    nginx
```
- This ensures all logs generated inside `/var/log/nginx` are accessible from the host system.  

### 📜 Viewing Logs in Real Time  
Use the following command to follow (stream) logs:  

```sh
docker logs -f nginx-container
```
- The `-f` flag streams logs as they are generated.  

## 🔥 Best Practices for Managing Regularly Changing Files  
- **Use Docker Volumes** for storing logs, configuration files, dependencies, and frequently updated content.  
- **Bind Mounts** are useful for quick changes, while **Named Volumes** offer better data persistence.  
- **Monitor Logs** by mounting log directories to an external location for easy access.  

By using Docker volumes effectively, you can manage configurations, track logs, and update files seamlessly without restarting or rebuilding containers. 🚀
